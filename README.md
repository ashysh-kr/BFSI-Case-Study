# BFSI-Case-Study

**Background**

All BFSI institutions are faced with a major default problem: not every individual that takes a loan has the willingness, ability and/or integrity to pay it back. Thus, an average of 2-5% default rate is observed across banks for different loan categories like personal loan, education loan, vehicle loan, business loan etc. Given the fact that banks can never get this number to zero, it has to keep it within limits, and rather keep it at the lowest possible levels to be able to retain the money inflow.

In this assignment, you would face real world data of applications and bureau as shared by Home Credit, to practice the end-to-end process of model development in Credit Risk for Banks, Financial Institutions and NBFCs. You would build a bank’s internal end-to-end scoring mechanism, based on the application information, clubbed with the raw bureau information.

**Objectives**

The primary objective of this study is to assist Home Credit in deciding which loan applications should be disbursed, and which should be rejected, based on the applicant’s past behaviour and application information.
As a business analyst for Home Credit, you are supposed to first gather the information and clean it to make it usable.
Apply ‘Feature Engineering’ techniques to roll up the information at applicant level, and thereby create manual features for model building. 
Build a classification model to differentiate applicants between approves and rejects.
